            Welcome to <span className="font-vernaccia-bold">Yankit</span>! These Terms of Service ("Terms") govern your use of the <span className="font-vernaccia-bold">Yankit</span> website, mobile applications, and services (collectively, the "Platform") provided by <span className="font-vernaccia-bold">Yankit</span> Air Courier ("<span className="font-vernaccia-bold">Yankit</span>," "we," "us," or "our"). By accessing or using our Platform, you agree to be bound by these Terms.
          </p>

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4 text-primary dark:text-secondary">1. Platform Overview</h2>
          <p>
            <span className="font-vernaccia-bold">Yankit</span> is a peer-to-peer platform that connects users who wish to send items ("Senders") with users who are travelling and have available baggage allowance to carry such items ("Yankers" or "Travellers"). <span className="font-vernaccia-bold">Yankit</span> facilitates these connections but is not a party to any agreement between Senders and Yankers, nor is it a carrier, freight forwarder, or logistics provider.
          </p>

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4 text-primary dark:text-secondary">2. Eligibility and Account Registration</h2>
          <p>
            You must be at least 18 years old to use the Platform. By registering for an account, you represent and warrant that all information you provide is accurate, current, and complete. You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your account credentials and for all activities that occur under your account.
          </p>

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4 text-primary dark:text-secondary">3. User Conduct and Responsibilities</h2>
          <p>As a user of the <span className="font-vernaccia-bold">Yankit</span> Platform, you agree to:</p>
          <ul className="list-disc list-inside ml-4 space-y-2">
            <li>Comply with all applicable local, state, national, and international laws and regulations, including customs and airline regulations.</li>
            <li>Provide accurate and truthful information in your listings, communications, and profile.</li>
            <li>Use the Platform for lawful purposes only and not to send or carry prohibited items (including, but not limited to, illegal substances, weapons, hazardous materials, counterfeit goods, or items restricted by airline or customs authorities).</li>
            <li>Communicate respectfully and professionally with other users.</li>
            <li>Not engage in fraudulent activities, misrepresentation, or any conduct that could harm <span className="font-vernaccia-bold">Yankit</span> or its users.</li>
            <li>Complete transactions agreed upon, unless a legitimate reason prevents it (e.g., cancellation agreed by both parties).</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Senders are solely responsible for the items they request to be carried. Yankers are solely responsible for the items they agree to carry and for ensuring compliance with all travel and customs regulations. <span className="font-vernaccia-bold">Yankit</span> explicitly disclaims any liability for the nature, legality, or condition of items exchanged through the Platform.
          </p>

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4 text-primary dark:text-secondary">4. Listings, Bookings, and Payments</h2>
          <ul className="list-disc list-inside ml-4 space-y-2">
            <li><strong>Listings:</strong> Yankers may create listings detailing their travel plans and available baggage space. Senders may search for these listings.</li>
            <li><strong>Agreements:</strong> Senders and Yankers negotiate and agree upon the terms of service (item(s), price, pickup/delivery) through the Platform's communication tools. This agreement forms a binding contract between the Sender and Yanker.</li>
            <li><strong>Payments:</strong> Senders pay the agreed-upon fee through the Platform. <span className="font-vernaccia-bold">Yankit</span> uses third-party payment processors (e.g., Stripe) to handle transactions. Funds are held by <span className="font-vernaccia-bold">Yankit</span> (or its processor) and released to the Yanker upon confirmation of successful delivery by the Sender.</li>
            <li><strong>Service Fees:</strong> <span className="font-vernaccia-bold">Yankit</span> charges a service fee to both Senders and Yankers for successfully completed transactions. These fees will be clearly communicated before confirming a transaction.</li>
            <li><strong>Cancellations and Refunds:</strong> Cancellation and refund policies will be detailed on the Platform and may depend on the timing of the cancellation and the agreement between users. <span className="font-vernaccia-bold">Yankit</span> reserves the right to mediate disputes regarding cancellations and refunds.</li>
          </ul>

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4 text-primary dark:text-secondary">5. Intellectual Property</h2>
