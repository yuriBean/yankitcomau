          <p>
            Safety is a shared responsibility. Here are some tips for Senders and Yankers:
          </p>
          <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-2 text-slate-800 dark:text-slate-100">For Senders:</h3>
          <ul className="list-disc list-inside ml-4 space-y-2">
            <li><strong>Be Clear and Honest:</strong> Accurately describe the items you want to send. Do not attempt to send prohibited items.</li>
            <li><strong>Communicate Thoroughly:</strong> Discuss all details with the Yanker via in-app chat, including item specifics, packaging, and pickup/drop-off arrangements.</li>
            <li><strong>Check Reviews:</strong> Look at the Yanker's profile, ratings, and reviews before finalizing an agreement.</li>
            <li><strong>Use Secure Payment:</strong> Always make payments through the <span className="font-vernaccia-bold">Yankit</span> platform. Do not engage in off-platform payments.</li>
            <li><strong>Confirm Receipt Promptly:</strong> Once you receive your items as agreed, confirm delivery on the platform so the Yanker can be paid.</li>
          </ul>

          <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-2 text-slate-800 dark:text-slate-100">For Yankers (Travellers):</h3>
          <ul className="list-disc list-inside ml-4 space-y-2">
            <li><strong>Know What You're Carrying:</strong> Communicate clearly with the Sender about the items. If you are uncomfortable with an item, do not agree to carry it. You have the right to inspect items (with the Sender's permission and presence if possible) to ensure they match the description and are not prohibited.</li>
            <li><strong>Understand Regulations:</strong> Be aware of customs and airline regulations for both your origin and destination countries regarding the items you agree to carry. You are responsible for complying with these laws.</li>
            <li><strong>Communicate Your Availability:</strong> Clearly state your travel dates and baggage capacity.</li>
            <li><strong>Check Reviews:</strong> Look at the Sender's profile, ratings, and reviews.</li>
            <li><strong>Report Suspicious Activity:</strong> If you encounter any suspicious requests or behaviour, report it to <span className="font-vernaccia-bold">Yankit</span> support immediately.</li>
          </ul>
